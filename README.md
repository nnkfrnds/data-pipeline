# Building a data pipeline with Python

Use case: company A and company B are now just one. Both companies have their own datasets, each one in different formats and all kinds of information.
How can we find value in that data? Well, now we have to merge the two datasets into one in a way that makes sense and have value for the new company.

What have been done here:
- Structured a data engeneering project;
- Read data with JSON library;  
- Read data with CSV library;
